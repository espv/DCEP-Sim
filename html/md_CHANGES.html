</div><!--header-->
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>ns-3 is an evolving system and there will be API or behavioral changes from time to time. Users who try to use scripts or models across versions of ns-3 may encounter problems at compile time, run time, or may see the simulation output change.</p>
<p>We have adopted the development policy that we are going to try to ease the impact of these changes on users by documenting these changes in a single place (this file), and not by providing a temporary or permanent backward-compatibility software layer.</p>
<p>A related file is the <a class="el" href="RELEASE__NOTES_8md.html">RELEASE_NOTES.md</a> file in the top level directory. This file complements <a class="el" href="RELEASE__NOTES_8md.html">RELEASE_NOTES.md</a> by focusing on API and behavioral changes that users upgrading from one release to the next may encounter. <a class="el" href="RELEASE__NOTES_8md.html">RELEASE_NOTES.md</a> attempts to comprehensively list all of the changes that were made. There is generally some overlap in the information contained in <a class="el" href="RELEASE__NOTES_8md.html">RELEASE_NOTES.md</a> and this file.</p>
<p>The goal is that users who encounter a problem when trying to use older code with newer code should be able to consult this file to find guidance as to how to fix the problem. For instance, if a method name or signature has changed, it should be stated what the new replacement name is.</p>
<p>Note that users who upgrade the simulator across versions, or who work directly out of the development tree, may find that simulation output changes even when the compilation doesn't break, such as when a simulator default value is changed. Therefore, it is good practice for _anyone_ using code across multiple ns-3 releases to consult this file, as well as the <a class="el" href="RELEASE__NOTES_8md.html">RELEASE_NOTES.md</a>, to understand what has changed over time.</p>
<p>This file is a best-effort approach to solving this issue; we will do our best but can guarantee that there will be things that fall through the cracks, unfortunately. If you, as a user, can suggest improvements to this file based on your experience, please contribute a patch or drop us a note on ns-developers mailing list.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md0"></a>
Changes from ns-3.36 to ns-3.36.1</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
New API</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>The PTHREAD-dependent classes (mutex, thread and condition variables) were removed and replaced with C++ STL libraries. The API of the STL libraries is very similar to the equivalent ns-3 classes. The main API differences are as follows:<ul>
<li><code>ns-3::SystemMutex</code> should be refactored to <code>std::mutex</code>.</li>
<li><code>ns-3::CriticalSection cs (m_mutex)</code> should be refactored to <code>std::unique_lock lock {m_mutex}</code>.</li>
<li><code>ns-3::SystemThread</code> should be refactored to <code>std::thread</code>, which, unlike SystemThread, starts the thread immediately.</li>
<li><code>ns-3::SystemCondition</code> should be refactored to <code>std::condition_variable</code>, which relies on a companion <code>std::mutex</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The macro for optionally including sqlite3-dependent code has been changed from STATS_HAVE_SQLITE3 to HAVE_SQLITE3, and is now defined globally. <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Changes to build system</h2>
<p>The build system API has not changed since ns-3.36. Several bugs were fixed and behavioral improvements were made; see the RELEASE_NOTES for details.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<p>Apart from the bugs fixed (listed in the RELEASE_NOTES), the simulation model behavior should not have changed since ns-3.36.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Changes from ns-3.35 to ns-3.36</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>The helpers of the NetDevices supporting flow control (PointToPointHelper, CsmaHelper, SimpleNetDeviceHelper, WifiHelper) now provide a <b>DisableFlowControl</b> method to disable flow control. If flow control is disabled, the Traffic Control layer forwards packets down to the NetDevice even if there is no room for them in the NetDevice queue(s)</li>
<li>Added a new trace source <b>TcDrop</b> in TrafficControlLayer for tracing packets that have been dropped because no queue disc is installed on the device, the device supports flow control and the device queue is full.</li>
<li>Added a new class <b>PhasedArraySpectrumPropagationLossModel</b>, and its <b>DoCalcRxPowerSpectralDensity</b> function has two additional parameters: TX and RX antenna arrays. Should be inherited by models that need to know antenna arrays in order to calculate RX PSD.</li>
<li>It is now possible to detach a SpectrumPhy object from a SpectrumChannel by calling SpectrumChannel::RemoveRx ().</li>
<li><b>PhasedArrayModel</b> has a new function GetId that returns a unique ID of each PhasedArrayModel instance.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for Network Simulation Cradle (NSC) TCP has been removed.</li>
<li>Support for PlanetLabFdNetDeviceHelper has been removed.</li>
<li><b>ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel</b> now inherits <b>PhasedArraySpectrumPropagationLossModel</b>. The modules that use <b>ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel</b> should implement <b>SpectrumPhy::GetAntenna</b> that will return the instance of <b>PhasedArrayModel</b>.</li>
<li><b>AddDevice</b> function is removed from <b>ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel</b> to support multiple arrays per device.</li>
<li><b>SpectrumPhy</b> function <b>GetRxAntenna</b> is renamed to <b>GetAntenna</b>, and its return value is changed to <em>Ptr&lt;Object&gt;</em> instead of <em>Ptr&lt;AntennaModel&gt;</em> to support also <b>PhasedArrayModel</b> type of antenna.</li>
<li><b>vScatt</b> attribute moved from ThreeGppSpectrumPropagationLossModel to ThreeGppChannelModel.</li>
<li><b>ChannelCondition::IsEqual</b> now has LOS and O2I parameters instead of a pointer to ChannelCondition.</li>
<li><b>TcpWestwood::EstimatedBW</b> trace source changed from <b>TracedValueCallback::Double</b> to <b>TracedValueCallback::DataRate</b>.</li>
<li>The API for making changes to channel number, band, standard, and primary channel has been changed to use a new ChannelSettings attribute.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Changes to build system</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Waf build system has been replaced by CMake and a Python program called 'n3' that provides a Waf-like API.</li>
<li>g++ version 8 is now the minimum g++ compiler version supported.</li>
<li>The default build profile has been changed from 'debug' to a new 'default'. Two key differences are that the new default has optimizations enabled (-O2 vs. previous -O0), and the -Werror flag is disabled. Select the 'debug' profile to disable optimizations and enable warnings as errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wi-Fi: The default Wi-Fi standard is changed from 802.11a to 802.11ax, and the default rate control is changed from ArfWifiManager to IdealWifiManager.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi: EDCAFs (QosTxop objects) are no longer installed on non-QoS STAs and DCF (Txop object) is no longer installed on QoS STAs.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi: Management frames (Probe Request/Response, Association Request/Response) are sent by QoS STAs according to the 802.11 specs.</li>
<li>The <b>Frequency</b>, <b>ChannelNumber</b>, <b>ChannelWidth</b> and <b>Primary20MHzIndex</b> attributes of <b>WifiPhy</b> can now only be used to get the corresponding values. Channel settings can be now configured through the <b>ChannelSettings</b> attribute. See the wifi model documentation for information on how to set this new attribute.</li>
<li>UE handover now works with and without enabled CA (carrier aggregation) in inter-eNB, intra-eNB, inter-frequency and intra-frequency scenarios. Previously only inter-eNB intra-frequency handover was supported and only in non-CA scenarios.</li>
<li>NixVectorRouting: <b>NixVectorRouting</b> can now better cope with topology changes. In-flight packets are not anymore causing crashes, and the path is dynamically rebuilt by intermediate routers (this happens only to packets in-flight during the topology change).</li>
<li>Mesh (Wi-Fi) forwarding hops now have a configurable random variable-based forwarding delay model, with a default mean of 350 us.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Changes from ns-3.34 to ns-3.35</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>In class <b>Ipv6Header</b>, new functions SetSource (), SetDestination (), GetSource () and GetDestination () are added, consistent with <b>Ipv4Header</b>. The existing functions had "Address" suffix in each of the function names, and are are deprecated now.</li>
<li>In class <b>Ipv4InterfaceAddress</b>, new functions SetAddress () and GetAddress () are added, corresponding to SetLocal () and GetLocal () respectively. This is done to keep consistency with <b>Ipv4InterfaceAddress</b>.</li>
<li>With the new support for IPv6 Nix-Vector routing, we have all the new APIs corresponding to IPv4 Nix-Vector routing. Specific to the user, there is an Ipv6NixVectorHelper class which can be set in the InternetStackHelper, and works similar to Ipv4NixVectorHelper.</li>
<li>In class <b>Ipv4InterfaceAddress</b>, a new function IsInSameSubnet () is added to check if both the IPv4 addresses are in the same subnet. Also, it is consistent with <b>Ipv6InterfaceAddress::IsInSameSubnet ()</b>.</li>
<li>In class <b>ConfigStore</b>, a new Attribue <b>SaveDeprecated</b> allows to not save DEPRECATED Attributes. The default value is <b>false</b> (save DEPRECATED Attributes).</li>
<li>In class <b>TracedCallback</b>, a new function <b>IsEmpty</b> allows to know if the TracedCallback will call any callback.</li>
<li>A new specialization of std::hash for Ptr allows one to use Ptrs as keys in unordered_map and unordered_set containers.</li>
<li>A new <b>GroupMobilityHelper</b> mobility helper has been added to ease the configuration of group mobility (a form of hierarchical mobility in which multiple child mobility models move with reference to an underlying parent mobility model). New example programs and animation scripts are also added to both the buildings and mobility modules.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>In class <b>Ipv6Header</b>, the functions SetSourceAddress (), SetDestinationAddress (), GetSourceAddress () and GetDestinationAddress () are deprecated. New corresponding functions are added by removing the "Address" suffix. This change is made for having consistency with <b>Ipv4Header</b>.</li>
<li><b>ipv4-nix-vector-helper.h</b> and <b>ipv4-nix-vector-routing.h</b> have been deprecated in favour of <b>nix-vector-helper.h</b> and <b>nix-vector-routing.h</b> respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
Changes to build system</h2>
<ul>
<li>The default C++ standard is now C++17.</li>
<li>The minimum compiler versions have been raised to g++-7 and clang-10 (Linux) and Xcode 11 (macOS).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nix-Vector routing supports topologies with multiple WiFi networks using the same WiFi channel object.</li>
<li>ConfigStore no longer saves OBSOLETE attributes.</li>
<li>The <b>Ipv4L3Protocol</b> Duplicate detection now accounts for transmitted packets, so a transmitting multicast node will not forward its own packets.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi: A-MSDU aggregation now implies that constituent MSDUs are immediately dequeued from the EDCA queue and replaced by an MPDU containing the A-MSDU. Thus, aggregating N MSDUs triggers N dequeue operations and 1 enqueue operation on the EDCA queue.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi: MPDUs being passed to the PHY layer for transmission are not dequeued, but are kept in the EDCA queue until they are acknowledged or discarded. Consequently, the BlockAckManager retransmit queue has been removed.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
Changes from ns-3.33 to ns-3.34</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
New features and API</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for Wi-Fi <b>802.11ax downlink and uplink OFDMA</b>, including multi-user OFDMA and a <b>round-robin multi-user scheduler</b>.</li>
<li><b>FqCobalt</b> queue disc with L4S features and set associative hash.</li>
<li><b>FqPIE</b> queue disc with L4S mode</li>
<li><b>ThompsonSamplingWifiManager</b> Wi-Fi rate control algorithm.</li>
<li>New <b>PhasedArrayModel</b>, providing a flexible interface for modeling a number of Phase Antenna Array (PAA) models.</li>
<li>Added the ability to configure the <b>Wi-Fi primary 20 MHz channel</b> for 802.11 devices operating on channels of width greater than 20 MHz.</li>
<li>A <b>TCP BBRv1</b> congestion control model.</li>
<li><b>Improved support for bit fields</b> in header serialization/deserialization.</li>
<li>Support for <b>IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC)</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <b>WifiAckPolicySelector</b> class has been replaced by the <b>WifiAckManager</b> class. Correspondingly, the ConstantWifiAckPolicySelector has been replaced by the WifiDefaultAckManager class. A new WifiProtectionManager abstract base class and WifiDefaultProtectionManager concrete class have been added to implement different protection policies.</li>
<li>The class <b>ThreeGppAntennaArrayModel</b> has been replaced by <b>UniformPlanarArray</b>, extending the PhasedArrayModel interface.</li>
<li>The <b>Angles struct</b> is now a class, with robust setters and getters (public struct variables phi and theta are now private class variables m_azimuth and m_inclination), overloaded operator&lt;&lt; and operator&gt;&gt; and a number of utilities.</li>
<li><b>AntennaModel</b> child classes have been extended to produce 3D radiation patterns. Attributes such as Beamwidth have thus been separated into Vertical/HorizontalBeamwidth.</li>
<li>The attribute <b>UseVhtOnly</b> in <b>MinstrelHtWifiManager</b> has been replaced by a new attribute called <b>UseLatestAmendmentOnly</b>.</li>
<li>The wifi module has <b>removed HT Greenfield support, Holland (802.11a-like) PHY configuration, and Point Coordination Function (PCF)</b></li>
<li>The wifi ErrorRateModel API has been extended to support <b>link-to-system models</b>.</li>
<li><b>Nix-Vector routing</b> supports multiple interface addresses and can print out routing paths.</li>
<li>The <b>TxOkHeader and TxErrHeader trace sources</b> of RegularWifiMac have been obsoleted and replaced by trace sources that better capture the result of a transmission: AckedMpdu (fired when an MPDU is successfully acknowledged, via either a Normal Ack or a Block Ack), NAckedMpdu (fired when an MPDU is negatively acknowledged via a Block Ack), DroppedMpdu (fired when an MPDU is dropped), MpduResponseTimeout (fired when a CTS is missing after an RTS or a Normal Ack is missing after an MPDU) and PsduResponseTimeout (fired when a BlockAck is missing after an A-MPDU or a BlockAckReq).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
Changes to build system</h2>
<ul>
<li>The handling of <b>Boost library/header dependencies</b> has been improved.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>The default <b>TCP congestion control</b> has been changed from NewReno to CUBIC.</li>
<li>The <b>PHY layer of the wifi module</b> has been refactored: the amendment-specific logic has been ported to <b>PhyEntity</b> classes and <b>WifiPpdu</b> classes.</li>
<li>The <b>MAC layer of the wifi module</b> has been refactored. The MacLow class has been replaced by a hierarchy of FrameExchangeManager classes, each adding support for the frame exchange sequences introduced by a given amendment.</li>
<li>The <b>wifi BCC AWGN error rate tables</b> have been aligned with the ones provided by MATLAB and users may note a few dB difference when using BCC at high SNR and high MCS.</li>
<li><b>ThreeGppChannelModel has been fixed</b>: cluster and sub-cluster angles could have been generated with inclination angles outside the inclination range [0, pi], and have now been constrained to the correct range.</li>
<li>The <b>LTE RLC Acknowledged Mode (AM) transmit buffer</b> is now limited by default to a size of (1024 * 10) bytes. Configuration of unlimited behavior can still be made by passing the value of zero to the new attribute <b>MaxTxBufferSize</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Changes from ns-3.32 to ns-3.33</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>A model for <b>TCP CUBIC</b> (RFC 8312) has been added.</li>
<li>New <b>channel models based on 3GPP TR 37.885</b> have been added to support vehicular simulations.</li>
<li><b>Time::RoundTo (unit)</b> allows time to be rounded to the nearest integer multiple of unit</li>
<li><b>UdpClient</b> now can report both transmitted and received bytes.</li>
<li>A new <b>MPI Enable()</b> variant was introduced that takes a user-supplied MPI_Communicator, allowing for partitioning of the MPI processes.</li>
<li>A <b>Length</b> class has been introduced to allow users to replace the use of raw numbers (ints, doubles) that have implicit lengths with a class that represents lengths with an explicit unit.</li>
<li>A flexible <b>CsvReader</b> class has been introduced to allow users to read in csv- or tab-delimited data.</li>
<li>The <b>ListPositionAllocator</b> can now input positions from a csv file.</li>
<li>A new trace source for DCTCP alpha value has been added to <b>TcpDctcp</b>.</li>
<li>A new <b>TableBasedErrorRateModel</b> has been added for Wi-Fi, and the default values are aligned with link-simulation results from MATLAB WLAN Toolbox and IEEE 802.11 TGn.</li>
<li>A new <b>LdpcSupported</b> attribute has been added for Wi-Fi in <b>HtConfiguration</b>, in order to select LDPC FEC encoding instead of the default BCC FEC encoding.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>The signature of <b>WifiPhy::PsduTxBeginCallback</b> and <b>WifiPhy::PhyTxPsduBegin</b> have been changed to take a map of PSDUs instead of a single PSDU in order to support multi-users (MU) transmissions.</li>
<li>The wifi trace <b>WifiPhy::PhyRxBegin</b> has been extended to report the received power for every band.</li>
<li>The wifi trace <b>WifiPhy::PhyRxBegin</b> has been extended to report the received power for every band.</li>
<li>New attributes <b>SpectrumWifiPhy::TxMaskInnerBandMinimumRejection</b>, <b>SpectrumWifiPhy::TxMaskOuterBandMinimumRejection</b> and <b>SpectrumWifiPhy::TxMaskOuterBandMaximumRejection</b> have been added to configure the OFDM transmit masks.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Changes to build system</h2>
<ul>
<li>Waf has been upgraded to git development version waf-2.0.21-6-g60e3f5f4</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <b>default Wi-Fi ErrorRateModel</b> for the 802.11n/ac/ax standards has been changed from the NistErrorRateModel to a new TableBasedErrorRateModel. Users may experience a shift in Wi-Fi link range due to the new default error model, as <b>the new model is more optimistic</b> (the PER for a given MCS will degrade at a lower SNR value). The Wi-Fi module documentation provides plots that compare the performance of the NIST and new table-based model.</li>
<li>The default value of the <b>BerThreshold</b> attribute in <b>IdealWifiManager</b> was changed from 1e-5 to 1e-6, so as to correct behavior with high order MCS.</li>
<li><b>Time values that are created from an int64x64_t value</b> are now rounded to the nearest integer multiple of the unit, rather than truncated. Issue #265 in the GitLab.com tracker describes the behavior that was fixed. Some Time values that rely on this conversion may have changed due to this fix.</li>
<li>TCP now implements the Linux-like <b>congestion window reduced (CWR)</b> state when explicit congestion notification (ECN) is enabled.</li>
<li><b>TcpDctcp</b> now inherits from <b>TcpLinuxReno</b>, making its congestion avoidance track more closely to that of Linux.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md25"></a>
Changes from ns-3.31 to ns-3.32</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26"></a>
New API</h2>

<li>Added <b>6 GHz band</b> support for Wi-Fi 802.11ax</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md27"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Sifs</b>, <b>Slot</b> and <b>Pifs</b> attributes have been moved from <b>WifiMac</b> to <b>WifiPhy</b> to better reflect that they are PHY characteristics, to decouple the MAC configuration from the PHY configuration and to ease the support for future standards.</li>
<li>The Histogram class was moved from the flow-monitor module to the stats module to make it more easily accessed. If you previously used Histogram by by including flow-monitor.h you will need to change that to stats-module.h.</li>
<li>The <b>WifiHelper::SetStandard (WifiPhyStandard standard)</b> method no longer takes a WifiPhyStandard enum, but instead takes a similarly named WifiStandard enum. If before you specified a value such as WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_xxx, now you must specify WIFI_STANDARD_xxx.</li>
<li>The <b>YansWifiPhyHelper::Default</b> and <b>SpectrumWifiPhyHelper::Default</b> methods have been removed; the default constructors may instead by used.</li>
<li><b>PIE</b> queue disc now uses <b>Timestamp</b> for queue delay calculation as default instead of <b>Dequeue Rate Estimator</b></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md28"></a>
Changes to build system</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added "--enable-asserts" and "--enable-logs" to waf configure, to selectively enable asserts and/or logs in release and optimized builds.</li>
<li>A build version reporting system has been added by extracting data from the local git repository (or a standalone file if a git repository is not present).</li>
<li>Added support for EditorConfig</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md29"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for <b>RIFS</b> has been dropped from wifi. RIFS has been obsoleted by the 802.11 standard and support for it was not implemented according to the standard.</li>
<li>The default loss recovery algorithm for TCP has been changed from Classic Recovery to Proportional Rate Reduction (PRR).</li>
<li>The behavior of <b>TcpPrrRecovery</b> algorithm was aligned to that of Linux.</li>
<li><b>PIE</b> queue disc now uses <b>Timestamp</b> for queue delay calculation as default instead of <b>Dequeue Rate Estimator</b></li>
<li>TCP pacing, when enabled, now adjusts the rate dynamically based on the window size, rather than just enforcing a constant rate.</li>
<li>WifiPhy forwards up MPDUs from an A-MPDU under reception as long as they arrive at the PHY, instead of forwarding up the whole A-MPDU once its reception is completed.</li>
<li>The ns-3 TCP model was changed to set the initial congestion window to 10 segments instead of 1 segment (to align with default Linux configuration).</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md30"></a>
Changes from ns-3.30 to ns-3.31</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md31"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <b>TCP DCTCP</b> model has been added.</li>
<li><b>3GPP TR 38.901</b> pathloss, channel condition, antenna array, and fast fading models have been added.</li>
<li>New **...FailSafe ()** variants of the <b>Config</b> and <b>Config::MatchContainer</b> functions which set Attributes or connect TraceSources. These all return a boolean indicating if any attributes could be set (or trace sources connected). These are useful if you are not sure that the requested objects exist, for example in AnimationInterface.</li>
<li>New attributes for <b>Ipv4L3Protocol</b> have been added to enable RFC 6621-based duplicate packet detection (DPD) (<b>EnableDuplicatePacketDetection</b>) and to control the cache expiration time (<b>DuplicateExpire</b>).</li>
<li><b>MakeConsistent</b> method of <b>BuildingsHelper</b> class is deprecated and moved to <b>MobilityBuildingInfo</b> class. <b>DoInitialize</b> method of the <b>MobilityBuildingInfo</b> class would be responsible for making the mobility model of a node consistent at the beginning of a simulation. Therefore, there is no need for an explicit call to <b>MakeConsistent</b> in a simulation script.</li>
<li>The <b>IsInside</b> method of <b>MobilityBuildingInfo</b> class is extended to make the mobility model of a moving node consistent.</li>
<li>The <b>IsOutside</b> method of <b>MobilityBuildingInfo</b> class is deprecated. The <b>IsInside</b> method should be use to check the position of a node.</li>
<li>A new abstract base class, <b>WifiAckPolicySelector</b>, is introduced to implement different techniques for selecting the acknowledgment policy for PSDUs containing QoS Data frames. Wifi, mesh and wave helpers provide a SetAckPolicySelectorForAc method to configure a specific ack policy selector for a given Access Category.</li>
<li>The default ack policy selector is named <b>ConstantWifiAckPolicySelector</b>, which allows to choose between Block Ack policy and Implicit Block Ack Request policy and allows to request an acknowledgment after a configurable number of MPDUs have been transmitted.</li>
<li>The <b>MaxSize</b> attribute is removed from the <b>QueueBase</b> base class and moved to subclasses. A new MaxSize attribute is therefore added to the DropTailQueue class, while the MaxQueueSize attribute of the WifiMacQueue class is renamed as MaxSize for API consistency.</li>
<li>Two new <b>Application sequence number and timestamp</b> variants have been added, to support packet delivery tracing.<ul>
<li>A new sequence and timestamp header variant for applications has been added. The <b>SeqTsEchoHeader</b> contains an additional timestamp field for use in echoing a timestamp back to a sender.</li>
<li>TCP-based applications (OnOffApplication, BulkSendApplication, and PacketSink) support a new header, <b>SeqTsSizeHeader</b>, to convey sequence number, timestamp, and size data. Use is controlled by the "EnableSeqTsSizeHeader" attribute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a new trace source <b>PhyRxPayloadBegin</b> in WifiPhy for tracing begin of PSDU reception.</li>
<li>Added the class <b>RandomWalk2dOutdoorMobilityModel</b> that models a random walk which does not enter any building.</li>
<li>Added support for the <b>Cake set-associative hash</b> in the FqCoDel queue disc</li>
<li>Added support for <b>ECN marking for CoDel and FqCoDel</b> queue discs</li>

<li>The API for <b>enabling and disabling ECN</b> in TCP sockets has been refactored.</li>
<li>The <b>LTE HARQ</b> related methods in LteEnbPhy and LteUePhy have been renamed, and the LteHelper updated.</li>
<li>Previously the <b>Config::Connect</b> and <b>Config::Set</b> families of functions would fail silently if the attribute or trace source didn't exist on the path given (typically due to spelling errors). Now those functions will throw a fatal error. If you need the old behavior use the new **...FailSafe ()** variants.</li>
<li>The internal TCP API for <b>TcpCongestionOps</b> has been extended to support the <b>CongControl</b> method to allow for delivery rate estimation feedback to the congestion control mechanism.</li>
<li>Functions <b>LteEnbPhy::ReceiveUlHarqFeedback</b> and <b>LteUePhy::ReceiveLteDlHarqFeedback</b> are renamed to <b>LteEnbPhy::ReportUlHarqFeedback</b> and <b>LteUePhy::EnqueueDlHarqFeedback</b>, respectively to avoid confusion about their functionality. <b>LteHelper</b> is updated accordingly.</li>
<li>Now on, instead of <b>uint8_t</b>, <b>uint16_t</b> would be used to store a bandwidth value in LTE.</li>
<li>The preferred way to declare instances of <b>CommandLine</b> is now through a macro: <b>COMMANDLINE (cmd)</b>. This enables us to add the <b>CommandLine::Usage()</b> message to the Doxygen for the program.</li>
<li>New **...FailSafe ()** variants of the <b>Config</b> is used to connect PDCP TraceSources of eNB and UE in <b>RadioBearerStatsConnector</b> class. It is required for the simulations using RLC SM where PDCP objects are not created for data radio bearers.</li>
<li><b>T310</b> timer in <b>LteUeRrc</b> class is stopped if the UE receives <b>RRCConnectionReconfiguration</b> including the <b>mobilityControlInfo</b>. This change is introduced following the 3GPP standard TS36331 sec 5.3.5.4.</li>
<li>The wifi <b>High Latency tags</b> have been removed. The only rate manager (Onoe) that was making use of them has been refactored.</li>
<li>The wifi <b>MIMO diversity model</b> has been changed to better fit with MRC theory for AWGN channels when STBC is not used (since STBC is currently not supported).</li>
<li>The <b>BuildingsHelper::MakeMobilityModelConsistent()</b> method is deprecated in favor of MobilityBuildingInfo::MakeConsistent</li>
<li>The <b>MobilityBuildingInfo::IsOutdoor ()</b> method is deprecated; use the result of IsIndoor() method instead</li>
<li>IsEqual() methods of class <b>Ipv4Address, Ipv4Mask, Ipv6Address, and Ipv6Prefix</b> are deprecated.</li>

Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <b>EmpiricalRandomVariable</b> no longer linearly interpolates between values by default, but instead will default to treating the CDF as a histogram and return one of the specific inputs. The previous interpolation mode can be configured by an attribute.</li>
<li>(as reported above) previously the <b>Config::Connect</b> and <b>Config::Set</b> families of functions would fail silently if the attribute or trace source didn't exist on the path given (typically due to spelling errors). Now those functions will throw a fatal error. If you need the old behavior use the new **...FailSafe ()** variants.</li>
<li>Attempting to deserialize an enum name which wasn't registered with <b>MakeEnumChecker</b> now causes a fatal error, rather failing silently. (This can be triggered by setting an enum Attribute from a StringValue.)</li>
<li>As a result of the above API changes in <b>MobilityBuildingInfo</b> and <b>BuildingsHelper</b> classes, a building aware pathloss models, e.g., <b>HybridBuildingsPropagationLossModel</b> is now able to accurately compute the pathloss for a node moving in and out of buildings in a simulation. See <a href="https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/issues/80">issue 80</a> for discussion.</li>
<li>The implementation of the <b>Wi-Fi channel access</b> functions has been improved to make them more conformant to the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard. Concerning the DCF, the backoff procedure is no longer invoked when a packet is queued for transmission and the medium has not been idle for a DIFS, but it is invoked if the medium is busy or does not remain idle for a DIFS after the packet has been queued. Concerning the EDCAF, tranmissions are now correctly aligned at slot boundaries.</li>
<li>Various wifi physical layer behavior around channel occupancy calculation, phy state calculation, and handling different channel widths has been updated.</li>

Instead, it is advised to use <b>WifiNetDevice::HtConfiguration</b>, <b>WifiNetDevice::VhtConfiguration</b> and <b>WifiNetDevice::HeConfiguration</b>.</li>
<li>The attributes **{Ht,Vht,He}Configuration::{Vo,Vi,Be,Bk}MaxAmsduSize** and **{Ht,Vht,He}Configuration::{Vo,Vi,Be,Bk}MaxAmpduSize** have been removed. Instead, it is necessary to use <b>RegularWifiMac::{VO, VI, BE, BK}_MaxAmsduSize</b> and <b>RegularWifiMac::{VO, VI, BE, BK}_MaxAmpduSize</b>.</li>
<li>A new attribute <b>WifiPhy::PostReceptionErrorModel</b> has been added to force specific packet drops.</li>

<li>New attributes <b>QosTxop::AddBaResponseTimeout</b> and <b>QosTxop::FailedAddBaTimeout</b> have been added to set the timeout to wait for an ADDBA response after the ACK to the ADDBA request is received and to set the timeout after a failed BA agreement, respectively.</li>
<li>A new attribute <b>QosTxop::UseExpliciteBarAfterMissedBlockAck</b> has been added to specify whether explicit Block Ack Request should be sent upon missed Block Ack Response.</li>
<li>Added a new trace source <b>EndOfHePreamble</b> in WifiPhy for tracing end of preamble (after training fields) for received 802.11ax packets.</li>
<li>Added a new helper method to SpectrumWifiPhyHelper and YansWifiPhyHelper to set the <b>frame capture model</b>.</li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md37"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the possibility of setting the z coordinate for many position-allocation classes: <b>GridPositionAllocator, RandomRectanglePositionAllocator, RandomDiscPositionAllocator, UniformDiscPositionAllocator</b>.</li>
<li>The WifiPhy attribute <b>CcaMode1Threshold</b> has been renamed to <b>CcaEdThreshold</b>, and the WifiPhy attribute <b>EnergyDetectionThreshold</b> has been replaced by a new attribute called <b>RxSensitivity</b>.</li>
<li>It is now possible to know the size of the SpectrumValue underlying std::vector, as well as accessing read-only every element of it.</li>
<li>The <b>GetClosestSide</b> method of the Rectangle class returns the correct closest side also for positions outside the rectangle.</li>
<li>The trace sources <b>BackoffTrace</b> and <b>CwTrace</b> were moved from class QosTxop to base class Txop, allowing these values to be traced for DCF operation. In addition, the trace signature for BackoffTrace was changed from TracedValue to TracedCallback (callback taking one argument instead of two). Most users of CwTrace for QosTxop configurations will not need to change existing programs, but users of BackoffTrace will need to adjust the callback signature to match.</li>
<li>New trace sources, namely <b>DrbCreated, Srb1Created and DrbCreated</b> have beed implemented in LteEnbRrc and LteUeRrc classes repectively. These new traces are used to improve the connection of the RLC and PDCP stats in the RadioBearerStatsConnector API.</li>
<li><b>TraceFadingLossModel</b> has been moved from lte to spectrum module.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md38"></a>
Changes to build system</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>ns-3 now only supports Python 3</b>. Use of Python 2 can be forced using the &ndash;with-python option provided to './waf configure', and may still work for many cases, but is no longer supported. Waf does not default to Python 3 but the ns-3 wscript will default the build to Python 3.</li>
<li>Waf upgraded from 2.0.9 to 2.0.18.</li>
<li>Options to run a program through Waf without invoking a project rebuild have been added. The command './waf &ndash;run-no-build ' parallels the behavior of './waf &ndash;run ' and, likewise, the command './waf &ndash;pyrun-no-build' parallels the behavior of './waf &ndash;pyrun '.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md39"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>The wifi ADDBA handshake process is now protected with the use of two timeouts who makes sure we do not end up in a blocked situation. If the handshake process is not established, packets that are in the queue are sent as normal MPDUs. Once handshake is successfully established, A-MPDUs can be transmitted.</li>
<li>In the wifi module, the default value of the <b>Margin</b> attribute in SimpleFrameCaptureModel was changed from 10 to 5 dB.</li>
<li>A <b>ThresholdPreambleDetectionModel</b> is added by default to the WifiPhy. Using default values, this model will discard frames that fall below either -82 dBm RSSI or below 4 dB SNR. Users may notice that weak wifi signals that were successfully received based on the error model alone (in previous ns-3 releases) are no longer received. Previous behavior can be obtained by lowering both threshold values or by removing the preamble detection model (via WifiPhyHelper::DisablePreambleDetectionModel()).</li>
<li>The PHY model for Wi-Fi has been extended to handle reception of L-SIG and reception of non-legacy header differently.</li>
<li>LTE/EPC model has been enhanced to allow the simulation user to test more realistic topologies related to the core network:</li>
<li>SGW, PGW and MME are full nodes.</li>
<li>There are P2P links between core network nodes.</li>
<li>New S5 interface between SGW and PGW nodes based on GTPv2-C protocol.</li>
<li>Allow simulations with multiple SGWs and PGWs.</li>
<li>LTE eNB RRC is extended to support:</li>
<li>S1 signalling with the core network is initiated after the RRC connection establishment procedure is finished.</li>
<li>New ATTACH_REQUEST state to wait for finalization of the S1 signalling with the core network.</li>
<li>New InitialContextSetupRequest primitive of the S1 SAP that is received by the eNB RRC when the S1 signalling from the core network is finished.</li>
<li>A new buffer has been introduced in the LteEnbRrc class. This buffer will be used by a target eNB during handover to buffer the packets comming from a source eNB on X2 inteface. The target eNB will buffer this data until it receives RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete from a UE.</li>
<li>The default qdisc installed on single-queue devices (such as PointToPoint, Csma and Simple) is now <b>FqCoDel</b> (instead of PfifoFast). On multi-queue devices (such as Wifi), the default root qdisc is now <b>Mq</b> with as many FqCoDel child qdiscs as the number of device queues. The new defaults are motivated by the willingness to align with the behavior of major Linux distributions and by the need to preserve the effectiveness of Wifi EDCA Functions in differentiating Access Categories (see issue #35).</li>
<li>LTE RLC TM mode does not report anymore the layer-to-layer delay, as it misses (by standard) an header to which attach the timestamp tag. Users can switch to the PDCP layer delay measurements, which must be the same.</li>
<li>Token Bank Fair Queue Scheduler (ns3::FdTbfqFfMacScheduler) will not anymore schedule a UE, which does not have any RBG left after removng the RBG from its allocation map if the computed TB size is greater than the "budget" computed in the scheduler.</li>
<li>LTE module now supports the <b>Radio Link Failure (RLF)</b> functionality. This implementation introduced following key behavioral changes:<ul>
<li>The UE RRC state will not remain in "CONNECTED\_NORMALLY" state if the DL control channel SINR is below a set threshold.</li>
<li>The LTE RRC protocol APIs of UE i.e., LteUeRrcProtocolIdeal, LteUeRrcProtocolReal have been extended to send an ideal (i.e., using SAPs instead to transmitting over the air) UE context remove request to the eNB. Similarly, the eNB RRC protocol APIs, i.e, LteEnbRrcProtocolIdeal and LteEnbRrcProtocolReal have been extended to receive this ideal UE context remove request.</li>
<li>The UE will not synchronize to a cell whose RSRP is less than -140 dBm.</li>
<li>The non-contention based preambles during a handover are re-assigning to an UE only if it has not been assign to another UE (An UE can be using the preamble even after the expiryTime duration).</li>
<li>The RachConfigCommon structure in LteRrcSap API has been extended to include "TxFailParam". This new field would enable an eNB to indicate how many times T300 timer can expire at the UE. Upon reaching this count, the UE aborts the connection establishment, and performs the cell selection again. See TS 36.331 5.3.3.6.</li>
<li>The timer T300 in LteUeRrc class is now bounded by the standard min and max values defined in 3GPP TS 36.331.</li>

<li>The QueueDisc base class now provides a default implementation of the DoPeek private method based on the QueueDisc::PeekDequeue method, which is now no longer available.</li>
<li>The QueueDisc::SojournTime trace source is changed from a TracedValue to a TracedCallback; callbacks that hook this trace must provide one ns3::Time argument, not two.</li>
<li><p class="startli">To avoid the code duplication in SingleModelSpectrumChannel and MultiModelSpectrumChannel classes, the attributes MaxLossDb and PropagationLossModel, and the traces PathLoss and TxSigParams are moved to the base class SpectrumChannel.

</ul>
</li>
<li>A new class were added for the RRPAA WiFi rate control mechanism.</li>
<li>Included carrier aggregation feature in LTE module</li>
<li>LTE model is extended to support carrier aggregation feature according to 3GPP Release 10, for up to 5 component carriers.</li>
<li>InstallSingleEnbDevice and InstalSingeUeDevice functions of LteHelper are now constructing LteEnbDevice and LteUeDevice according to CA architecture. Each device, UE and eNodeB contains an instance of component carrier manager, and may have several component carrier instances.</li>
<li>SAP interfaces are extended to include CA message exchange functionality.</li>
<li>RRC connection procedure is extended to allow RRC connection reconfiguration for the configuration of the secondary carriers.</li>
<li>RRC measurement reporting is extended to allow measurement reporting from the secondary carriers.</li>
<li>LTE traces are extended to include component carrier id.</li>
<li>Function <b>PrintRoutingTable</b> has been extended to add an optional Time::Units parameter to specify the time units used on the report. The new parameter is optional and if not specified defaults to the previous behavior (Time::S).</li>
<li><b>TxopTrace</b>: new trace source exported by EdcaTxopN.</li>
<li>A <b>GetDscpCounts</b> method is added to <b>Ipv4FlowClassifier</b> and <b>Ipv6FlowClassifier</b> which returns a vector of pairs (dscp,count), each of which indicates how many packets with the associated dscp value have been classified for a given flow.</li>
<li>MqQueueDisc, a multi-queue aware queue disc modelled after the mq qdisc in Linux, has been introduced.</li>
<li>Two new methods, <b>QueueDisc::DropBeforeEnqueue()</b> and <b>QueueDisc::DropAfterDequeue()</b> have been introduced to replace <b>QueueDisc::Drop()</b>. These new methods require the caller to specify the reason why a packet was dropped. Correspondingly, two new trace sources ("DropBeforeEnqueue" and "DropAfterDequeue") have been added to the QueueDisc class, providing both the items that were dropped and the reason why they were dropped.</li>
<li>Added <b>QueueDisc::GetStats()</b> which returns detailed statistics about the operations of a queue disc. Statistics can be accessed through the member variables of the returned object and by calling the <b>GetNDroppedPackets()</b>, <b>GetNDroppedBytes()</b>, <b>GetNMarkedPackets()</b> and <b>GetNMarkedBytes()</b> methods on the returned object. Such methods return the number of packets/bytes dropped/marked for the specified reason (passed as argument). Consequently:<ul>
<li>A number of methods of the QueueDisc class have been removed: <b>GetTotalReceivedPackets()</b>, <b>GetTotalReceivedBytes()</b>, <b>GetTotalDroppedPackets()</b>, <b>GetTotalDroppedBytes()</b>, <b>GetTotalRequeuedPackets()</b>, <b>GetTotalRequeuedBytes()</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>Stats</b> struct and the <b>GetStats()</b> method of <b>RedQueueDisc</b> and <b>PieQueueDisc</b> have been removed and replaced by those of the QueueDisc base class.</li>
<li>The <b>GetDropOverLimit</b> and <b>GetDropCount</b> methods of <b>CoDelQueueDisc</b> have been removed. The values they returned can be obtained by calling, respectively, GetStats ().GetNDroppedPackets (CoDelQueueDisc::OVERLIMIT_DROP) and GetStats ().GetNDroppedPackets (CoDelQueueDisc::TARGET_EXCEEDED_DROP). The "DropCount" trace of <b>CoDelQueueDisc</b> has been removed as well. Packets dropped because the target is exceeded can be obtained through the new "DropAfterDequeue" trace of the QueueDisc class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new <b>QueueDisc::Mark()</b> method has been introduced to allow subclasses to request to mark a packet. The caller must specify the reason why the packet must be marked. Correspondingly, a new trace source ("Mark") has been added to the QueueDisc class, providing both the items that were marked and the reason why they were marked.</li>
<li>A new trace source, <b>SojournTime</b>, is exported by the QueueDisc base class to provide the sojourn time of every packet dequeued from a queue disc. This has been made possible by adding a timestamp to QueueDiscItem objects, which can be set/get through the new <b>GetTimeStamp()</b> and <b>SetTimeStamp()</b> methods of the QueueDiscItem class. The <b>CoDel</b> queue disc now makes use of such feature of the base class, hence its Sojourn trace source and the CoDelTimestampTag class have been removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>ParetoRandomVariable</b> "Mean" attribute has been deprecated, the "Scale" Attribute have to be used instead. Changing the Mean attribute has no more an effect on the distribution. See the documentation for the relationship between Mean, Scale and Shape.</li>
<li>The default logging timestamp precision has been changed from 6 digits to 9 digits, with a fixed format to ensure that 9 digits to the right of the decimal point are always printed. Previously, default C++ iostream precision and formatting was used.</li>
<li>Abstract base class <b>WifiChannel</b> has been removed. As a result, a Channel type instead of a WifiChannel type is now exported by WifiNetDevice.</li>
<li>The <b>GetPacketSize</b> method of <b>QueueItem</b> has been renamed <b>GetSize</b></li>
<li>The <b>DequeueAll</b> method of <b>Queue</b> has been renamed <b>Flush</b></li>
<li>The attributes <b>WifiPhy::TxAntennas</b> and <b>WifiPhy::RxAntennas</b>, and the related accessor methods, were replaced by <b>WifiPhy::MaxSupportedTxSpatialStreams</b> and <b>WifiPhy::MaxSupportedRxSpatialStreams</b>. A new attribute <b>WifiPhy::Antennas</b> was added to allow users to define the number of physical antennas on the device.</li>
<li><p class="startli">Sockets do not receive anymore broadcast packets, unless they are bound to an "Any" address (0.0.0.0) or to a subnet-directed broadcast packet (e.g., x.y.z.0 for a /24 noterok). As in Linux, the following rules are now enforced:</p><ul>
<li>A socket bound to 0.0.0.0 will receive everything.</li>
<li>A socket bound to x.y.z.0/24 will receive subnet-directed broadcast (x.y.z.255) and unicast packets.</li>
<li>A socket bound to x.y.z.w will only receive unicast packets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli"><b>Previously, a socket bound to an unicast address received also subnet-directed broadcast packets. This is not anymore possible</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>You can now Bind as many socket as you want to an address/port, provided that they are bound to different NetDevices. Moreover, BindToNetDevice does not anymore call Bind. In other terms, Bind and BindToNetDevice can be called in any order. However, it is suggested to use BindToNetDevice <em>before</em> Bind in order to avoid conflicts.</li>

<li>The API scanning process for Python bindings now relies on CastXML, and only 64-bit scans are presently supported (Linux 64-bit systems). Generation of 32-bit scans is documented in the Python chapter of the ns-3 manual.</li>
<li>Modules can now be located in the 'contrib/' directory in addition to 'src/'</li>
<li>Behavior for running Python programs was aligned with that of C++ programs; the list of modules built is no longer printed out.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md54"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>MultiModelSpectrumChannel</b> does not call StartRx for receivers that operate on subbands orthogonal to transmitter subbands. Models that depend on receiving signals with zero power spectral density from orthogonal bands may change their behavior. See <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2467">bug 2467</a> for discussion.</li>
<li><b>Packet Tag objects</b> are no longer constrained to fit within 21 bytes; a maximum size is no longer enforced.</li>
<li>The default value of the <b>TxGain</b> and <b>RxGain</b> attributes in WifiPhy was changed from 1 dB to 0 dB.</li>
<li>The reported SNR by WifiPhy::MonitorSnifferRx did not include the RxNoiseFigure, but now does; see <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2783">bug 2783</a> for discussion.</li>
<li><b>Queue</b> has been redesigned as a template class object, where the type parameter specifies the type of items to be stored in the queue. As a consequence:<ul>
<li>Being a subclass of Queue, <b>DropTailQueue</b> is a template class as well.</li>
<li>Network devices such as SimpleNetDevice, PointToPointNetDevice and CsmaNetDevice use a queue of type Queue&lt;Packet&gt; to store the packets to transmit. The SetQueue method of their helpers, however, can still be invoked as, e.g., SetQueue ("ns3::DropTailQueue") instead of, e.g., SetQueue ("ns3::DropTailQueue&lt;Packet&gt;").</li>
<li>The attributes <b>Mode</b>, <b>MaxPackets</b> and <b>MaxBytes</b> are now defined by the QueueBase class (which Queue is derived from).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Queue discs that can operate both in packet mode and byte mode (Red, CoDel, Pie) define their own enum QueueDiscMode instead of using QueueBase::QueueMode.</li>
<li>The CoDel, PIE and RED queue discs require that the size of the internal queue is the same as the queue disc limit (previously, it was allowed to be greater than or equal).</li>
<li>The default value of the <b>EnableBeaconJitter</b> attribute in ApWifiMac was changed from false to true.</li>
<li>The NormalClose() callback of a TcpSocket object used to fire upon leaving TIME_WAIT state (2*MSL after FINs have been exchanged). It now fires upon entering TIME_WAIT state. Timing of the callback for the other path to state CLOSED (through LAST_ACK) has not been changed.</li>
</ul>

Changes from ns-3.25 to ns-3.26</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md56"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <b>SocketPriorityTag</b> is introduced to carry the packet priority. Such a tag is added to packets by sockets that support this mechanism (UdpSocketImpl, TcpSocketBase and PacketSocket). The base class Socket has a new SetPriority method to set the socket priority. When the IPv4 protocol is used, the priority is set based on the ToS. See the Socket options section of the Network model for more information.</li>
<li>A <b>WifiNetDevice::SelectQueue</b> method has been added to determine the user priority of an MSDU. This method is called by the traffic control layer before enqueuing a packet in the queue disc, if a queue disc is installed on the outgoing device, or passing a packet to the device, otherwise. The user priority is set to the three most significant bits of the DS field (TOS field in case of IPv4 and Traffic Class field in case of IPv6). The packet priority carried by the SocketPriorityTag is set to the user priority.</li>
<li>The <b>PfifoFastQueueDisc</b> classifies packets into bands based on their priority. See the pfifo_fast queue disc section of the Traffic Control Layer model for more information.</li>
<li>A new class <b>SpectrumWifiPhy</b> has been introduced that makes use of the Spectrum module. Its functionality and API is currently very similar to that of the YansWifiPhy, especially because it reuses the same InterferenceHelper and ErrorModel classes (for this release). Some example programs in the 'examples/wireless/' directory, such as 'wifi-spectrum-per-example.cc', illustrate how the SpectrumWifiPhy class can be substituted for the default YansWifiPhy PHY model.</li>
<li>We have added support for generating traces for the <a href="https://wilseypa.github.io/desMetrics">DES Metrics</a> project. These can be enabled by adding --enable-des-metrics at configuration; you must also use CommandLine in your script. See the API docs for class <b>DesMetrics</b> for more details.</li>
<li>The traffic control module now includes the <b>FQ-CoDel</b> and <b>PIE</b> queue disc models, and behavior corresponding to Linux <b>Byte Queue Limits (BQL)</b>.</li>
<li>Several new TCP congestion control variants were introduced, including <b>TCP Vegas, Scalable, Veno, Illinois, Bic, YeAH, and H-TCP</b> congestion control algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md57"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>SocketAddressTag</b> was a long-standing approach to approximate the POSIX socket recvfrom behavior (i.e., to know the source address of a packet) without actually calling RecvFrom. Experience with this revealed that this option was difficult to use with tunnels (the new tag has to replace the old one). Moreover, there is no real need to create a new API when there is a an existing one (i.e., RecvFrom). As a consequence, SocketAddressTag has been completely removed from ns-3. Users can use RecvFrom (for UDP), GetPeerName (for TCP), or similar.</li>
<li><b>InetSockAddress</b> can now store a ToS value, which can be set through its SetTos method. The Bind and Connect methods of UDP (UdpSocketImpl) and TCP (TcpSocketBase) sockets set the socket ToS value to the value provided through the address input parameter (of type InetSockAddress). See the Socket options section of the Network model for more information.</li>
<li>The <b>QosTag</b> is removed as it has been superseded by the SocketPriorityTag.</li>
<li>The <b>Ipv4L3Protocol::DefaultTos</b> attribute is removed.</li>
<li>The attributes <b>YansWifiPhy::Frequency, YansWifiPhy::ChannelNumber, and YansWifiPhy::ChannelWidth</b>, and the related accessor methods, were moved to base class WifiPhy. YansWifiPhy::GetChannelFrequencyMhz() was deleted. A new method WifiPhy::DefineChannelNumber () was added to allow users to define relationships between channel number, standard, frequency, and channel width.</li>
<li>The class <b>WifiSpectrumValueHelper</b> has been refactored; previously it was an abstract base class supporting the WifiSpectrumValue5MhzFactory spectrum model. It now contains various static member methods supporting the creation of power spectral densities with the granularity of a Wi-Fi OFDM subcarrier bandwidth. The class <b>WifiSpectrumValue5MhzFactory</b> and its API remain but it is not subclassed.</li>
<li>A new Wifi method <b>InterferenceHelper::AddForeignSignal</b> has been introduced to support use of the SpectrumWifiPhy (so that non-Wi-Fi signals may be handled as noise power).</li>
<li>A new Wifi attribute <b>Dcf::TxopLimit</b> has been introduced to add support for 802.11e TXOP.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md58"></a>

<li>A new waf build option, --check-config, was added to allow users to print the current configuration summary, as appears at the end of ./waf configure. See bug 2459 for discussion.</li>
<li>The configure summary is now sorted, to make it easier to check the status of optional features.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md59"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<p>This section is for behavioral changes to the models that were not due to a bug fix.</p>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between Wi-Fi channel number, frequency, channel width, and Wi-Fi standard has been revised (see bug 2412). Previously, ChannelNumber and Frequency were attributes of class YansWifiPhy, and the frequency was defined as the start of the band. Now, Frequency has been redefined to be the center frequency of the channel, and the underlying device relies on the pair of frequency and channel width to control behavior; the channel number and Wi-Fi standard are used as attributes to configure frequency and channel width. The wifi module documentation discusses this change and the new behavior.</li>
<li>AODV now honors the TTL in RREQ/RREP and it uses a method compliant with <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3561.txt">RFC 3561</a>. The node search radius is increased progressively. This could increase slightly the node search time, but it also decreases the network congestion.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md60"></a>
Changes from ns-3.24 to ns-3.25</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md61"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 'src/internet/test', a new environment is created to test TCP properties.</li>
<li>The 'src/traffic-control' module has been added, with new API for adding and configuring queue discs and packet filters.</li>
<li>Related to traffic control, a new interface has been added to the NetDevice to provide a queue interface to access device queue state and register callbacks used for flow control.</li>
<li>In 'src/wifi', a new rate control (MinstrelHT) has been added for 802.11n/ac modes.</li>
<li>In 'src/wifi', a new helper (WifiMacHelper) is added and is a merged helper from all previously existing MAC helpers (NqosWifiMacHelper, QosWifiMacHelper, HtWifiMacHelper and VhtWifiMacHelper).</li>
<li>It is now possible to use RIPv2 in IPv4 network simulations.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md62"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>TCP-related changes:<ul>
<li>Classes TcpRfc793, TcpTahoe, and TcpReno were removed.</li>
<li>The 'TcpNewReno' log component was effectively replaced by 'TcpCongestionOps'</li>
<li>TCP Hybla and HighSpeed have been added.</li>
<li>Added the concept of Congestion State Machine inside TcpSocketBase.</li>
<li>Merged Fast Recovery and Fast Retransmit inside TcpSocketBase.</li>
<li>Some member variables have been moved from TcpSocketBase inside TcpSocketState. Attributes are not touched.</li>
<li>Congestion control split from TcpSocketBase as subclass of TcpCongestionOps.</li>
<li>Added Rx and Tx callbacks on TcpSocketBase.</li>
<li>Added BytesInFlight trace source on TcpSocketBase. The trace is updated when the implementation requests the value.</li>
<li>Added attributes about the number of connection and data retransmission attempts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ns-3 is now capable of serializing SLL (a.k.a. cooked) headers. This is used in DCE to allow the generation of pcap directly readable by wireshark.</li>
<li>In the WifiHelper class in the wifi module, Default has been declared deprecated. This is now immediately handled by the constructor of the class.</li>
<li>The API for configuring 802.11n/ac aggregation has been modified to be more user friendly. As any MAC layer attributes, aggregation parameters can now also be configured through WifiMacHelper::SetType.</li>
<li>The class Queue and subclasses derived from it have been changed in two ways:<ul>
<li>Queues no longer enqueue simple Packets but instead enqueue QueueItem objects, which include Packet but possibly other information such as headers.</li>
<li>The attributes governing the mode of operation (packets or bytes) and the maximum size have been moved to base class Queue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Users of advanced queues (RED, CoDel) who have been using them directly in the NetDevice will need to adjust to the following changes:<ul>
<li>RED and CoDel are no longer specializations of the Queue class, but are now specializations of the new QueueDisc class. This means that RED and CoDel can now be installed in the context of the new Traffic Control layer instead of as queues in (some) NetDevices. The reason for such a change is to make the ns-3 stack much more similar to that of real operating systems (Linux has been taken as a reference). Queuing disciplines such as RED and CoDel can now be tested with all the NetDevices, including WifiNetDevices.</li>
<li>NetDevices still use queues to buffer packets. The only subclass of Queue currently available for this purpose is DropTailQueue. If one wants to approximate the old behavior, one needs to set the DropTailQueue MaxPackets attribute to very low values, e.g., 1.</li>
<li>The Traffic Control layer features a mechanism by which packets dropped by the NetDevice are requeued in the queue disc (more precisely: if NetDevice::Send returns false, the packet is requeued), so that they are retransmitted later. This means that the MAC drop traces may include packets that have not been actually lost, because they have been dropped by the device, requeued by the traffic control layer and successfully retransmitted. To get the correct number of packets that have been actually lost, one has to subtract the number of packets requeued from the number of packets dropped as reported by the MAC drop trace.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>TCP closes connection after a number of failed segment retries, rather than trying indefinitely. The maximum number of retries, for both SYN attempts and data attempts, is controlled by attributes.</li>
<li>Congestion algorithms not compliant with Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery (TCP 793, Reno, Tahoe) have been removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>802.11n/ac MPDU aggregation is now enabled by default for both AC_BE and AC_VI.</li>
<li>The introduction of the traffic control layer leads to some additional buffering by default in the stack; when a device queue fills up, additional packets become enqueued at the traffic control layer.</li>

<li>The CongestionWindow and SlowStartThreshold trace sources have been moved from the TCP subclasses such as NewReno, Reno, Tahoe, and Westwood to the TcpSocketBase class.</li>
<li>The WifiMode object has been refactored:<ul>
<li>11n data rates are now renamed according to their MCS value. E.g. OfdmRate65MbpsBW20MHz has been renamed into HtMcs7. 11ac data rates have been defined according to this new renaming.</li>
<li>HtWifiMacHelper and VhtWifiMacHelper provide a helper to convert a MCS value into a data rate value.</li>
<li>The channel width is no longer tied to the wifimode. It is now included in the TXVECTOR.</li>

<li>The default value of the `Speed` attribute of ConstantSpeedPropagationDelayModel was changed from 300,000,000 m/s to 299,792,458 m/s (speed of light in a vacuum), causing propagation delays using this model to vary slightly.</li>
<li>The LrWpanHelper object was previously instantiating only a LogDistancePropagationLossModel on a SingleModelSpectrumChannel, but no PropagationDelayModel. The constructor now adds by default a ConstantSpeedPropagationDelayModel.</li>
<li>The Nix-vector routing implementation now uses a lazy flush mechanism, which dramatically speeds up the creation of large topologies.</li>

<ul>
<li>New "const double&amp; SpectrumValue:: operator\[\] (size\_t index) const".</li>
<li>A new TraceSource has been added to TCP sockets: SlowStartThreshold.</li>
<li>New method CommandLine::AddValue (name, attibutePath) to provide a shorthand argument "name" for the Attribute "path". This also has the effect of including the help string for the Attribute in the Usage message.</li>
<li>The GSoC 2014 project in the LTE module has brought some additional APIs:<ul>
<li>a new abstract class LteFfrAlgorithm, which every future implementation of frequency reuse algorithm should inherit from</li>
<li>a new SAPs: one between MAC Scheduler and FrAlgorithm, one between RRC and FrAlgorithm</li>
<li>new attribute to enable Uplink Power Control in LteUePhy</li>
<li>new LteUePowerControl class, an implementation of Uplink Power Control, which is configurable by attributes. ReferenceSignalPower is sent by eNB in SIB2. Uplink Power Control in Closed Loop Accumulative Mode is enabled by default</li>
<li>seven different Frequency Reuse Algorithms (each has its own attributes):</li>
<li>LteFrNoOpAlgorithm</li>
<li>LteFrHardAlgorithm</li>
<li>LteFrStrictAlgorithm</li>
<li>LteFrSoftAlgorithm</li>
<li>LteFfrSoftAlgorithm</li>

Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Icmpv6L4Protocol::ForgeEchoRequest" is now returning a packet with the proper IPv6 header.</li>
<li>The TCP socket Attribute "SlowStartThreshold" has been renamed "InitialSlowStartThreshold" to clarify that the effect is only on the initial value.</li>
<li>all schedulers were updated to interact with FR entity via FFR-SAP. Only PF, PSS, CQA, FD-TBFQ, TD-TBFQ schedulers supports Frequency Reuse functionality. In the beginning of scheduling process, schedulers ask FR entity for available RBGs and then ask if UE can be scheduled on RB</li>
<li>eNB RRC interacts with FFR entity via RRC-FFR SAP</li>
<li>new DL-CQI generation approach was implemented. Now DL-CQI is computed from control channel as signal and data channel (if received) as interference. New attribute in LteHelper was added to specify DL-CQI generation approach. New approach is default one in LteHelper</li>
<li>RadioEnvironmentMap can be generated for Data or Control channel and for specified RbId; Data or Control channel and RbId can be configured by new attributes in RadioEnvironmentMapHelper</li>
<li>lte-sinr-chunk-processor refactored to lte-chunk-processor. Removed all lte-xxx-chunk-processor implementations</li>
<li>BindToNetDevice affects also sockets using IPv6.</li>
<li>BindToNetDevice now calls implicitly Bind (). To bind a socket to a NetDevice and to a specific address, the correct sequence is Bind (address) - BindToNetDevice (device). The opposite will raise an error.</li>

Changes from ns-3.19 to ns-3.20</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md86"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>Models have been added for low-rate, wireless personal area networks (LR-WPAN) as specified by IEEE standard 802.15.4 (2006). The current emphasis is on the unslotted mode of 802.15.4 operation for use in Zigbee, and the scope is limited to enabling a single mode (CSMA/CA) with basic data transfer capabilities. Association with PAN coordinators is not yet supported, nor the use of extended addressing. Interference is modeled as AWGN but this is currently not thoroughly tested. The NetDevice Tx queue is not limited, i.e., packets are never dropped due to queue becoming full. They may be dropped due to excessive transmission retries or channel access failure.</li>
<li>A new IPv6 routing protocol has been added: RIPng. This protocol is an Interior Gateway Protocol and it is available in the Internet module.</li>
<li>A new LTE MAC downlink scheduling algorithm named Channel and QoS Aware (CQA) Scheduler is provided by the new "ns3::CqaFfMacScheduler" object.</li>
<li>Units may be attached to Time objects, to facilitate specific output formats (see Time::As())</li>
<li>FlowMonitor "SerializeToXml" functions are now directly available from the helper.</li>
<li>Access to OLSR's HNA table has been enabled</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md87"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>The SixLowPan model can now use uncompressed IPv6 headers. An option to define the minimum compressed packet size has been added.</li>
<li>MinDistance wsa replaced by MinLoss in FriisPropagationLossModel, to better handle conditions outside of the assumed far field region.</li>
<li>In the DSR model, the attribute DsrOptionRerrHeader::ErrorType" has been removed.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md88"></a>
Changes to build system</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.3 is now supported for Python bindings for ns-3. Python 3.3 support for API scanning is not supported. Python 3.2 is not supported.</li>
<li>Enable selection of high precision int64x64_t implementation at configure time, for debugging purposes.</li>
<li>Optimized builds are now enabling signed overflow optimization (-fstrict-overflow) and for gcc 4.8.2 and greater, also warning for cases where an optimizization may occur due to compiler assumption that overflow will not occur.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md89"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Internet FlowMonitor can now track IPv6 packets.</li>
<li>Ipv6Extension::m_dropTrace has been removed. Ipv6L3Protocol::m_dropTrace is now fired when appropriate.</li>
<li>IPv4 identification field value is now dependent on the protocol field.</li>
<li>Point-to-point trace sources now contain PPP headers</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md90"></a>
Changes from ns-3.18.1 to ns-3.19</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md91"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>A new wifi extension for vehicular simulation support is available in the src/wave directory. The current code represents an interim capability to realize an IEEE 802.11p-compliant device, but without the WAVE extensions (which are planned for a later patch). The WaveNetDevice modelled herein enforces that a WAVE-compliant physical layer (at 5.9 GHz) is selected, and does not require any association between devices (similar to an adhoc WiFi MAC), but is otherwise similar (at this time) to a WifiNetDevice. WAVE capabililties of switching between control and service channels, or using multiple radios, are not yet modelled.</li>
<li>New SixLowPanNetDevice class providing a shim between IPv6 and real NetDevices. The new module implements 6LoWPAN: "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks" (see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4944.txt">RFC 4944</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6262.txt">RFC 6262</a>), resulting in a heavy header compression for IPv6 packets. The module is intended to be used on 802.15.4 NetDevices, but it can be used over other NetDevices. See the manual for further discussion.</li>
<li>LteHelper has been updated with some new APIs:<ul>
<li>new overloaded Attach methods to enable UE to automatically determine the eNodeB to attach to (using initial cell selection);</li>
<li>new methods related to handover algorithm: SetHandoverAlgorithmType and SetHandoverAlgorithmAttribute;</li>
<li>a new attribute AnrEnabled to activate/deactivate Automatic Neighbour Relation (ANR) function; and</li>
<li>a new method SetUeDeviceAttribute for configuring LteUeNetDevice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The GSoC 2013 project in the LTE module has brought some additional APIs:<ul>
<li>a new abstract class LteHandoverAlgorithm, which every future implementation of automatic handover trigger should inherit from;</li>
<li>new classes LteHandoverAlgorithm and LteAnr as sub-modules of LteEnbNetDevice class; both interfacing with the LteEnbRrc sub-module through Handover Management SAP and ANR SAP;</li>
<li>new attributes in LteEnbNetDevice and LteUeNetDevice classes related to Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) functionality in initial cell selection;</li>
<li>new attributes in LteEnbRrc for configuring UE measurements' filtering coefficient (i.e., quantity configuration);</li>
<li>a new public method AddUeMeasReportConfig in LteEnbRrc for setting up custom UE measurements' reporting configuration; measurement reports can then be captured from the RecvMeasurementReport trace source; and</li>
<li>new trace sources in LteUeRrc to capture more events, such as System Information messages (MIB, SIB1, SIB2), initial cell selection, random access, and handover.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new parallel scheduling algorithm based on null messages, a common parallel DES scheduling algorithm, has been added. The null message scheduler has better scaling properties when running on some scenarios with large numbers of nodes since it does not require a global communication.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md92"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to use Ipv6PacketInfoTag from UDP applications in the same way as with Ipv4PacketInfoTag. See Doxygen for current limitations in using Ipv[4,6]PacketInfoTag to set IP properties.</li>
<li>A change is introduced for the usage of the EpcHelper class. Previously, the EpcHelper class included both the API definition and its (only) implementation; as such, users would instantiate and use the EpcHelper class directly in their simulation programs. From now on, EpcHelper is just the base class defining the API, and the implementation has been moved to derived classes; as such, users are now expected to use one of the derived classes in their simulation program. The implementation previously provided by the EpcHelper class has been moved to the new derived class PointToPointEpcHelper.</li>
<li>The automatic handover trigger and ANR functions in LTE module have been moved from LteEnbRrc class to separate classes. As a result, the related attributes, e.g., ServingCellHandoverThreshold, NeighbourCellHandoverOffset, EventA2Threshold, and EventA4Threshold have been removed from LteEnbRrc class. The equivalent attributes are now in A2A4RsrqHandoverAlgorithm and LteAnr classes.</li>
<li>Master Information Block (MIB) and System Information Block Type 1 (SIB1) are now transmitted as LTE control messages, so they are no longer part of RRC protocol.</li>
<li>UE RRC state model in LTE module has been considerably modified and is not backward compatible with the previous state model.</li>
<li>Additional time units (Year, Day, Hour, Minute) were added to the time value class that represents simulation time; the largest unit prior to this addition was Second.</li>
<li>SimpleNetDevice and SimpleChannel are not so simple anymore. SimpleNetDevice can be now a Broadcast or PointToPoint NetDevice, it can have a limited bandwidth and it uses an output queue.</li>
</ul>

Changes to build system</h2>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md94"></a>
Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the TapBridge device, in UseLocal mode there is a MAC learning function. TapBridge has been waiting for the first packet received from tap interface to set the address of the bridged device to the source address of the first packet. This has caused problems with WiFi. The new behavior is that after connection to the tap interface, ns-3 learns the MAC address of that interface with a system call and immediately sets the address of the bridged device to the learned one. See <a href="https://www.nsnam.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1777">bug 1777</a> for more details.</li>
<li>TapBridge device now correctly implements IsLinkUp() method.</li>
<li>IPv6 addresses and routing tables are printed like in Linux "route -A inet6" command.</li>
<li>A change in Ipv[4,6]Interface enforces the correct behaviour of IP when a device do not support the minimum MTU requirements. This is set to 68 and 1280 octects respectively. IP simulations that may have run over devices with smaller MTUs than 68 or 1280, respectively, will no longer be able to use such devices.</li>

<ul>
<li>It is now possible to randomize the time of the first beacon from an access point. Use an attribute "EnableBeaconJitter" to enable/disable this feature.</li>

Changes from ns-3.17 to ns-3.18</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md101"></a>
New API</h2>
<ul>
<li>New features have been added to the LTE module:<ul>
<li>PHY support for UE measurements (RSRP and RSRQ)</li>
<li>RRC support for UE measurements (configuration, execution, reporting)</li>
<li>Automatic Handover trigger based on RRC UE measurement reports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data collection components have been added in the 'src/stats' module. Data collection includes a Probe class that attaches to ns-3 trace sources to filter their output, and two Aggregator classes for marshaling probed data into text files or gnuplot plots. The ns-3 tutorial has been extended to illustrate basic functionality.</li>
<li>In 'src/wifi', several changes were made to enable partial 802.11n support:<ul>
<li>A new helper (HtWifiMacHelper) was added to set up a High Throughput (HT) MAC entity</li>
<li>New attributes were added to help the user setup a High Throughput (HT) PHY entity. These attributes can be set using the YansWifiPhyHelper</li>
<li>A new standard value has been added that enables the new 11n data rates.</li>
<li>New 11n preambles has been added (Mixed format and greenfield). To be able to change Tx duration according to the preamble used, a new class TxVector has been added to carry the transmission parameters (mode, preamble, stbc,..). Several functions have been updated to allow the passage of TxVector instead of WifiMode in MacLow, WifiRemoteStationManager, WifiPhy, YansWifiPhy,..</li>
<li>A new information element has been added: HTCapabilities. This information element is added to the MAC frame header if the node is an HT node. This HTCapabilites information element is used to advertise the HT capabilities of the node to other nodes in the network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>InternetStackHelper has two new functions:SetIpv4ArpJitter (bool enable) and SetIpv6NsRsJitter (bool enable) to enable/disable the random jitter on the tranmission of IPv4 ARP Request and IPv6 NS/RS.</li>
<li>Bounds on valid time inputs for time attributes can now be enabled. See attribute-test-suite.cc for an example.</li>
<li>New generic hash function interface provided in the simulation core. Two hash functions are provided: murmur3 (default), and the venerable FNV1a. See the Hash Functions section in the ns-3 manual.</li>
<li>New Mac16Address has been added. It can be used with IPv6 to make an Autoconfigured address.</li>
<li>Mac64Address support has been extended. It can now be used with IPv6 to make an Autoconfigured address.</li>
<li>IPv6 can now detect and use Path-MTU. See examples/ipv6/fragmentation-ipv6-two-MTU.cc for an example.</li>
<li>Radvd application has a new Helper. See the updated examples/ipv6/radvd.cc for an example.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md102"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Ipv6InterfaceContainer functions to set a node in forwarding state (i.e., a router) and to install a default router in a group of nodes have been extensively changed. The old function void Ipv6InterfaceContainer::SetRouter (uint32_t i, bool router) is now DEPRECATED.</li>
<li>The documentation's IPv6 addresses (2001:db8::/32, RFC 3849) are now dropped by routers.</li>
<li>The 'src/tools' module has been removed, and most files migrated to 'src/stats'. For users of these programs (the statistics-processing in average.h, or the gnuplot support), the main change is likely to be replacing the inclusion of "tools-module.h" with "stats-module.h". Users of the event garbage collector, previously in tools, will now include it from the core module.</li>
<li>The Ipv6 UnicastForwardCallback and MulticastForwardCallback have a new parameter, the NetDevice the packet has been received from. Existing Ipv6RoutingProtocols should update their RouteInput function accordingly, e.g., from ucb (rtentry, p, header); to ucb (idev, rtentry, p, header);</li>
<li>The previous buildings module relied on a specific MobilityModel called BuildingsMobilityModel, which supported buildings but only allowed static positions. This mobility model has been removed. Now, the Buildings module instead relies on a new class called MobilityBuildingInfo which can be aggregated to any MobilityModel. This allows having moving nodes in presence of buildings with any of the existing MobilityModels.</li>
<li>All functions in WifiRemoteStationManager named GetXxxMode have been changed to GetXxxTxVector</li>

</li>
<li>Command line boolean arguments specified with no integer value (e.g. "--boolArg") will toggle the value from the default, instead of always setting the value to true.</li>
<li>IPv4's ARP Request and IPv6's NS/RS are now transmitted with a random delay. The delay is, by default, a uniform random variable in time between 0 and 10ms. This is aimed at preventing reception errors due to collisions during wifi broadcasts when the sending behavior is synchronized (e.g. due to applications starting at the same time on several different nodes). This behaviour can be modified by using ArpL3Protocol's RequestJitter and Icmpv6L4Protocol's SolicitationJitter attributes or by using the new InternetStackHelper functions.</li>
<li>AODV Hellos are disabled by default. The performance with Hellos enabled and disabled are almost identical. With Hellos enabled, AODV will suppress hellos from transmission, if any recent broadcast such as RREQ was transmitted. The attribute ns3::aodv::RoutingProtocol::EnableHello can be used to enable/disable Hellos.</li>

<li>DSR link layer notification has changed. The model originally used "TxErrHeader" in Ptr to indicate the transmission error of a specific packet in link layer; however, it was not working correctly. The model now uses a different path to implement the link layer notification mechanism; specifically, looking into the trace file to find packet receive events. If the model finds one receive event for the data packet, it is used as the indicator for successful data delivery.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the Socket class, the following functions were added:<ul>
<li>(Set/Get)IpTos - sets IP Type of Service field in the IP headers.</li>
<li>(Set/Is)IpRecvTos - tells the socket to pass information about IP ToS up the stack (by adding SocketIpTosTag to the packet).</li>

<li>In the MobilityHelper class, the functions EnableAscii () and EnableAsciiAll () were changed to use output stream wrappers rather than standard C++ ostreams. The purpose of this change was to make them behave analogously to other helpers in ns-3 that generate ascii traces. Now, the file stream that is open in MobilityHelper is closed nicely upon asserts and program exits.</li>
</ul>

Simply calling Ipv4Header::EnableChecksum() for a single Ipv4Header will not work.</li>
<li>Now MultiModelSpectrumChannel allows a SpectrumPhy instance to change SpectrumModel at runtime by issuing a call to MultiModelSpectrumChannel::AddRx (). Previously, MultiModelSpectrumChannel required each SpectrumPhy instance to stick with the same SpectrumModel for the whole simulation.</li>

Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Ipv6RawSocketImpl "IcmpFilter" attribute has been removed. Six new member functions have been added to enable the same functionality.</li>
<li>IPv6 support for TCP and UDP has been implemented. Socket functions that take an address [e.g. Send (), Connect (), Bind ()] can accept an ns3::Ipv6Address or a ns3::Address in addition to taking an ns3::Ipv4Address. (Note that the ns3::Address must contain a ns3::Ipv6Address or a ns3::Ipv4Address, otherwise these functions will return an error). Internally, the socket now stores the remote address as a type "ns3::Address" instead of a type "ns3::Ipv4Address". The IPv6 Routing Header extension is not currently supported in ns3 and will not be reflected in the TCP and UDP checksum calculations per RFC 2460. Also note that UDP checksums for IPv6 packets are required per RFC, but remain optional and disabled by default in ns3 (in the interest of performance).</li>
<li>When calling Bind () on a socket without an address, the behavior remains the same: it will bind to the IPv4 "any" address (0.0.0.0). In order to Bind () to the IPv6 "any" address in a similar fashion, use "Bind6 ()".</li>
<li>The prototype for the RxCallback function in the Ipv6EndPoint was changed. It now includes the destination IPv6 address of the end point which was needed for TCP. This lead to a small change in the UDP and ICMPv6 L4 protocols as well.</li>
<li>Ipv6RoutingHelper can now print the IPv6 Routing Tables at specific intervals or time. Exactly like Ipv4RoutingHelper do.</li>
<li>New "SendIcmpv6Redirect" attribute (and getter/setter functions) to Ipv6L3Protocol. The behavior is similar to Linux's conf "send\_redirects", i.e., enable/disable the ICMPv6 Redirect sending.</li>
<li><p class="startli">The SpectrumPhy abstract class now has a new method</p>
<p class="startli">virtual Ptr&lt;AntennaModel&gt; GetRxAntenna () = 0;</p>
<p class="startli">that all derived classes need to implement in order to integrate properly with the newly added antenna model. In addition, a new member variable "Ptr&lt;AntennaModel&gt; txAntenna" has been added to SpectrumSignalParameters in order to allow derived SpectrumPhy classes to provide information about the antenna model used for the transmission of a waveform.</p>
</li>
<li>The Ns2CalendarScheduler event scheduler has been removed.</li>
<li>ErrorUnit enum has been moved into RateErrorModel class, and symbols EU_BIT, EU_BYTE and EU_PKT have been renamed to RateErrorModel::ERROR_UNIT_BIT, RateErrorModel::ERROR_UNIT_BYTE and RateErrorModel::ERROR_UNIT_PACKET. RateErrorModel class attribute "ErrorUnit" values have also been renamed for consistency, and are now "ERROR\_UNIT\_BIT", "ERROR\_UNIT\_BYTE", "ERROR\_UNIT\_PACKET".</li>
<li>QueueMode enum from DropTailQueue and RedQueue classes has been unified and moved to Queueu class. Symbols DropTailQueue::PACKETS and DropTailQueue::BYTES are now named Queue::QUEUE_MODE_PACKETS and DropTailQueue::QUEUE_MODE_BYTES. In addition, DropTailQueue and RedQueue class attributes "Mode" have been renamed for consistency from "Packets" and "Bytes" to "QUEUE\_MODE\_PACKETS" and "QUEUE\_MODE\_BYTES".</li>
<li>The API of the LTE module has undergone a significant redesign with the merge of the code from the LENA project. The new API is not backwards compatible with the previous version of the LTE module.</li>
<li>The Ipv6AddressHelper API has been aligned with the Ipv4AddressHelper API. The helper can be set with a call to Ipv6AddressHelper::SetBase (Ipv6Address network, Ipv6Prefix prefix) instead of NewNetwork (Ipv6Address network, Ipv6Prefix prefix). A new NewAddress (void) method has been added. Typical usage will involve calls to SetBase (), NewNetwork (), and NewAddress (), as in class Ipv4AddressHelper.</li>

<ul>
<li>The underlying version of waf used by ns-3 was upgraded to 1.6.7. This has a few changes for users and developers:<ul>
<li>by default, "build" no longer has a subdirectory debug or optimized. To get different build directories for different build types, you can use the waf configure -o option, e.g.: <pre class="fragment">./waf configure -o shared
./waf configure --enable-static -o static
</pre></li>
<li>(for developers) the ns3headers taskgen needs to be created with a features parameter name: <pre class="fragment">-  headers = bld.new\_task\_gen('ns3header')
+  headers = bld.new\_task\_gen(features=\['ns3header'\])
</pre></li>
<li>no longer need to edit src/wscript to add a module, just create your module directory inside src and ns-3 will pick it up</li>
<li>In WAF 1.6, adding -Dxxx options is done via the DEFINES env. var. instead of CXXDEFINES</li>
<li>waf env values are always lists now, e.g. env['PYTHON'] returns ['/usr/bin/python'], so you may need to add [0] to the value in some places</li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md128"></a>
Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the spectrum module, the parameters to SpectrumChannel::StartTx () and SpectrumPhy::StartRx () methods are now passed using the new struct SpectrumSignalParameters. This new struct supports inheritance, hence it allows technology-specific PHY implementations to provide technology-specific parameters in SpectrumChannel::StartTx() and SpectrumPhy::StartRx(), while at the same time keeping a set of technology-independent parameters common across all spectrum-enabled PHY implementations (i.e., the duration and the power spectral density which are needed for interference calculation). Additionally, the SpectrumType class has been removed, since now the type of a spectrum signal can be inferred by doing a dynamic cast on SpectrumSignalParameters. See the <a href="http://mailman.isi.edu/pipermail/ns-developers/2011-October/009495.html">Spectrum API change discussion on ns-developers</a> for the motivation behind this API change.</li>
<li>The WifiPhyStandard enumerators for specifying half- and quarter-channel width standards has had a change in capitalization:<ul>
<li>WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_80211_10Mhz was changed to WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_80211_10MHZ</li>
<li>WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_80211_5Mhz was changed to WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_80211_5MHZ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the SpectrumPhy base class, the methods to get/set the MobilityModel and the NetDevice were previously working with opaque Ptr&lt;Object&gt;. Now all these methods have been changed so that they work with Ptr&lt;NetDevice&gt; and Ptr&lt;MobilityModel&gt; as appropriate.

<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Consolidation of Wi-Fi MAC high functionality</b></p>
<p class="startli">Wi-Fi MAC high classes have been reorganised in attempt to consolidate shared functionality into a single class. This new class is RegularWifiMac, and it derives from the abstract WifiMac, and is parent of AdhocWifiMac, StaWifiMac, ApWifiMac, and MeshWifiInterfaceMac. The QoS and non-QoS class variants are no longer, with a RegularWifiMac attribute "QosSupported" allowing selection between these two modes of operation. QosWifiMacHelper and NqosWifiMacHelper continue to work as previously, with a behind-the-scenes manipulation of the 'afore-mentioned attribute.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>New TCP architecture</b></p>
<p class="startli">TcpSocketImpl was replaced by a new base class TcpSocketBase and several subclasses implementing different congestion control. From a user-level API perspective, the main change is that a new attribute "SocketType" is available in TcpL4Protocol, to which a TypeIdValue of a specific Tcp variant can be passed. In the same class, the attribute "RttEstimatorFactory" was also renamed "RttEstimatorType" since it now takes a TypeIdValue instead of an ObjectFactoryValue. In most cases, however, no change to existing user programs should be needed.</p>

<li><b>Respond to interface events:</b> New attribute for Ipv4GlobalRouting, "RespondToInterfaceEvents", which when enabled, will cause global routes to be recomputed upon any interface or address notification event from IPv4.</li>
<li><b>Generic sequence number:</b> New generic sequence number class to easily handle comparison, subtraction, etc. for sequence numbers. To use it you need to supply two fundamental types as template parameters: NUMERIC_TYPE and SIGNED_TYPE. For instance, SequenceNumber&lt;uint32_t, int32_t&gt; gives you a 32-bit sequence number, while SequenceNumber&lt;uint16_t, int16_t&gt; is a 16-bit one. For your convenience, these are typedef'ed as SequenceNumber32 and SequenceNumber16, respectively.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Changes to construction and naming of Wi-Fi transmit rates:</b> A reorganisation of the construction of Wi-Fi transmit rates has been undertaken with the aim of simplifying the task of supporting further IEEE 802.11 PHYs. This work has been completed under the auspices of Bug 871. From the viewpoint of simulation scripts not part of the ns-3 distribution, the key change is that WifiMode names of the form wifi_x_-_n_mbs are now invalid. Names now take the form <em>Cccc_Rate_n_Mbps[BW_b_MHz], where _n</em> is the root bitrate in megabits-per-second as before (with only significant figures included, and an underscore replacing any decimal point), and <em>Cccc</em> is a representation of the Modulation Class as defined in Table 9-2 of IEEE Std. 802.11-2007. Currently-supported options for <em>Cccc</em> are <em>Ofdm</em> and <em>Dsss</em>. For modulation classes where optional reduced-bandwidth transmission is possible, this is captured in the final part of the form above, with <em>b</em> specifying the nominal signal bandwidth in megahertz.</li>
<li><b>Consolidation of classes support Wi-Fi Information Elements:</b> When the <em>mesh</em> module was introduced it added a class hierarchy for modelling of the various Information Elements that were required. In this release, this class hierarchy has extended by moving the base classes (WifiInformationElement and WifiInformationElementVector) into the <em>wifi</em> module. This change is intended to ease the addition of support for modelling of further Wi-Fi functionality.</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Changed for {Ipv4,Ipv6}PacketInfoTag delivery:</b> In order to deliver ancillary information to the socket interface (fixed in bug 671), <em>Ipv4PacketInfoTag</em> and <em>Ipv6PacketInfoTag</em> are implemented.

Changed behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Queue trace behavior during Enqueue changed:</b> The behavior of the Enqueue trace source has been changed to be more intuitive and to agree with documentation. Enqueue and Drop events in src/node/queue.cc are now mutually exclusive. In the past, the meaning of an Enqueue event was that the Queue Enqueue operation was being attempted; and this could be followed by a Drop event if the Queue was full. The new behavior is such that a packet is either Enqueue'd successfully or Drop'ped.</li>
<li><b>Drop trace logged for Ipv4/6 forwarding failure:</b> Fixed bug 861; this will add ascii traces (drops) in Ipv4 and Ipv6 traces for forwarding failures</li>
<li><b>Changed default WiFi error rate model for OFDM modulation types:</b> Adopted more conservative ErrorRateModel for OFDM modulation types (a/g). This will require 4 to 5 more dB of received power to get similar results as before, so users may observe a reduced WiFi range when using the defaults. See tracker issue 944 for more details.</li>

<li><b>WiMAX net device</b>: The developed WiMAX model attempts to provide an accurate MAC and PHY level implementation of the 802.16 specification with the Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) mode and the WirelessMAN-OFDM PHY layer. By adding WimaxNetDevice objects to ns-3 nodes, one can create models of 802.16-based networks. The source code for the WiMAX models lives in the directory src/devices/wimax. The model is mainly composed of three layers:<ul>
<li>The convergence sublayer (CS)</li>
<li>The MAC Common Part Sublayer (MAC-CPS)</li>
<li>The Physical layerThe main way that users who write simulation scripts will typically interact with the Wimax models is through the helper API and through the publicly visible attributes of the model. The helper API is defined in src/helper/wimax-helper.{cc,h}. Three examples containing some code that shows how to setup a 802.16 network are located under examples/wimax/</li>

<li><b>GetSystemId in simulator:</b> For use with distributed simulation, GetSystemId returns zero by non-distributed simulators. For the distributed simulator, it returns the MPI rank.</li>
<li><b>Enhancements to src/core/random-variable.cc/h:</b> New Zeta random variable generator. The Zeta random distribution is tightly related to the Zipf distribution (already in ns-3.7). See the documentation, especially because sometimes the Zeta distribution is called Zipf and viceversa.

Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Tracing Helpers</b>: The organization of helpers for both pcap and ascii tracing, in devices and protocols, has been reworked. Instead of each device and protocol helper re-implementing trace enable methods, classes have been developed to implement user-level tracing in a consistent way; and device and protocol helpers use those classes to provide tracing functionality. <br  />
 In addition to consistent operation across all helpers, the object name service has been integrated into the trace file naming scheme. <br  />
 The internet stack helper has been extensively massaged to make it easier to manage traces originating from protocols. It used to be the case that there was essentially no opportunity to filter tracing on interfaces, and resulting trace file names collided with those created by devices. File names are now disambiguated and one can enable traces on a protocol/interface basis analogously to the node/device granularity of device-based helpers. <br  />
 The primary user-visible results of this change are that trace-related functions have been changed from static functions to method calls; and a new object has been developed to hold streams for ascii traces. <br  />
 New functionality is present for ascii traces. It is now possible to create multiple ascii trace files automatically just as was possible for pcap trace files. <br  />
 The implementation of the helper code has been designed also to provide functionality to make it easier for sophisticated users to hook traces of various kinds and write results to (file) streams. Before:</p>
<p class="startli">CsmaHelper::EnablePcapAll ();</p>

Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><b>InterferenceHelper</b></p>
<p class="startli">The method InterferenceHelper::CalculateTxDuration (uint32_t size, WifiMode payloadMode, WifiPreamble preamble) has been made static, so that the frame duration depends only on the characteristics of the frame (i.e., the function parameters) and not on the particular standard which is used by the receiving PHY. This makes it now possible to correctly calculate the duration of incoming frames in scenarios in which devices using different PHY configurations coexist in the same channel (e.g., a BSS using short preamble and another BSS using long preamble).</p>
<p class="startli">The following member methods have been added to InterferenceHelper:</p>
<p class="startli">static WifiMode GetPlcpHeaderMode (WifiMode, WifiPreamble); static uint32_t GetPlcpHeaderDurationMicroSeconds (WifiMode, WifiPreamble); static uint32_t GetPlcpPreambleDurationMicroSeconds (WifiMode, WifiPreamble); static uint32_t GetPayloadDurationMicroSeconds (size, WifiMode);</p>
<p class="startli">The following member methods have been removed from InterferenceHelper:</p>
<p class="startli">void Configure80211aParameters (void); void Configure80211bParameters (void); void Configure80211_10MhzParameters (void); void Configure80211_5MhzParameters (void);</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>WifiMode</b></p>
<p class="startli">WifiMode now has a WifiPhyStandard attribute which identifies the standard the WifiMode belongs to. To properly set this attribute when creating a new WifiMode, it is now required to explicitly pass a WifiPhyStandard parameter to all WifiModeFactory::CreateXXXX() methods. The WifiPhyStandard value of an existing WifiMode can be retrieved using the new method WifiMode::GetStandard().</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>NetDevice</b></p>
<p class="startli">In order to have multiple link change callback in NetDevice (i.e. to flush ARP and IPv6 neighbor discovery caches), the following member method has been renamed:</p>
<p class="startli">- virtual void SetLinkChangeCallback (Callback&lt;void&gt; callback);</p><ul>
<li>virtual void AddLinkChangeCallback (Callback&lt;void&gt; callback);</li>

<li><p class="startli"><b>YansWifiPhyHelper supporting radiotap and prism PCAP output</b></p>
<p class="startli">The newly supported pcap formats can be adopted by calling the following new method of YansWifiPhyHelper:</p><ul>
<li>void SetPcapFormat (enum PcapFormat format);</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">where format is one of PCAP_FORMAT_80211_RADIOTAP, PCAP_FORMAT_80211_PRISM or PCAP_FORMAT_80211. By default, PCAP_FORMAT_80211 is used, so the default PCAP format is the same as before.</p>

</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>packet tags</b></p>
<p class="startli">class Packet now contains AddPacketTag, RemovePacketTag and PeekPacketTag which can be used to attach a tag to a packet, as opposed to the old AddTag method which attached a tag to a set of bytes. The main semantic difference is in how these tags behave in the presence of fragmentation and reassembly.</p>

Changes to existing API</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Ipv4Interface::GetMtu () deleted</b></p>
<p class="startli">The Ipv4Interface API is private to internet-stack module; this method was just a pass-through to GetDevice ()-&gt;GetMtu ().</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>GlobalRouteManager::PopulateRoutingTables () and RecomputeRoutingTables () are deprecated</b></p>
<p class="startli">This API has been moved to the helper API and the above functions will be removed in ns-3.6. The new API is:</p>
<p class="startli">Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper::PopulateRoutingTables (); Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper::RecomputeRoutingTables ();</p>
<p class="startli">Additionally, these low-level functions in GlobalRouteManager are now public, allowing more API flexibility at the low level ns-3 API:</p>
<p class="startli">GlobalRouteManager::DeleteGlobalRoutes (); GlobalRouteManager::BuildGlobalRoutingDatabase (); GlobalRouteManager::InitializeRoutes ();</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>CalcChecksum attribute changes</b></p>
<p class="startli">Four IPv4 CalcChecksum attributes (which enable the computation of checksums that are disabled by default) have been collapsed into one global value in class Node. These four calls:</p>

<li><p class="startli"><b>YansWifiPhyHelper::EnablePcap* methods not static any more</b></p>
<p class="startli">To accommodate the possibility of configuring the PCAP format used for wifi promiscuous mode traces, several methods of YansWifiPhyHelper had to be made non-static:</p>
<p class="startli">- static void EnablePcap (std::string filename, uint32_t nodeid, uint32_t deviceid);</p><ul>
<li>void EnablePcap (std::string filename, uint32_t nodeid, uint32_t deviceid);</li>

<li>void EnablePcapAll (std::string filename);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Wifi Promisc Sniff interface modified</b></p>
<p class="startli">To accommodate support for the radiotap and prism headers in PCAP traces, the interface for promiscuos mode sniff in the wifi device was changed. The new implementation was heavily inspired by the way the madwifi driver handles monitor mode. A distinction between TX and RX events is introduced, to account for the fact that different information is to be put in the radiotap/prism header (e.g., RSSI and noise make sense only for RX packets). The following are the relevant modifications to the WifiPhy class:</p>
<p class="startli">- void NotifyPromiscSniff (Ptr&lt;const Packet&gt; packet);</p><ul>
<li>void NotifyPromiscSniffRx (Ptr&lt;const Packet&gt; packet, uint16_t channelFreqMhz, uint32_t rate, bool isShortPreamble, double signalDbm, double noiseDbm);</li>
<li>void NotifyPromiscSniffTx (Ptr&lt;const Packet&gt; packet, uint16_t channelFreqMhz, uint32_t rate, bool isShortPreamble);</li>
<li>TracedCallback&lt;Ptr&lt;const Packet&gt; &gt; m_phyPromiscSnifferTrace;</li>
<li>TracedCallback&lt;Ptr&lt;const Packet&gt;, uint16_t, uint32_t, bool, double, double&gt; m_phyPromiscSniffRxTrace;</li>
<li>TracedCallback&lt;Ptr&lt;const Packet&gt;, uint16_t, uint32_t, bool&gt; m_phyPromiscSniffTxTrace;</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">The above mentioned callbacks are expected to be used to call the following method to write Wifi PCAP traces in promiscuous mode:</p>
<p class="startli">+ void WriteWifiMonitorPacket(Ptr&lt;const Packet&gt; packet, uint16_t channelFreqMhz, uint32_t rate, bool isShortPreamble, bool isTx, double signalDbm, double noiseDbm);</p>
<p class="startli">In the above method, the isTx parameter is to be used to differentiate between TX and RX packets. For an example of how to implement these callbacks, see the implementation of PcapSniffTxEvent and PcapSniffRxEvent in src/helper/yans-wifi-helper.cc</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Routing decoupled from class Ipv4</b></p>
<p class="startli">All calls of the form "Ipv4::AddHostRouteTo ()" etc. (i.e. to add static routes, both unicast and multicast) have been moved to a new class Ipv4StaticRouting. In addition, class Ipv4 now holds only one possible routing protocol; the previous way to add routing protocols (by ordered list of priority) has been moved to a new class Ipv4ListRouting. Class Ipv4 has a new minimal routing API (just to set and get the routing protocol):</p>
<p class="startli">- virtual void AddRoutingProtocol (Ptr&lt;Ipv4RoutingProtocol&gt; routingProtocol, int16_t priority) = 0;</p><ul>

<li><p class="startli"><b>class Ipv4RoutingProtocol is refactored</b></p>
<p class="startli">The abstract base class Ipv4RoutingProtocol has been refactored to align with corresponding Linux Ipv4 routing architecture, and has been moved from ipv4.h to a new file ipv4-routing-protocol.h. The new methods (RouteOutput () and RouteInput ()) are aligned with Linux ip_route_output() and ip_route_input(). However, the general nature of these calls (synchronous routing lookup for locally originated packets, and an asynchronous, callback-based lookup for forwarded packets) is still the same.</p>

<li>The trace sources in the various NetDevice classes has been completely reworked to allow for a consistent set of trace sources across the devices. The names of the trace sources have been changed to provide some context with respect to the level at which the trace occurred. A new set of trace sources has been added which emulates the behavior of packet sniffers. These sources have been used to implement tcpdump- like functionality and are plumbed up into the helper classes. The user-visible changes are the trace source name changes and the ability to do promiscuous-mode pcap tracing via helpers. For further information regarding these changes, please see the ns-3 manual</li>

<li>The Callback templates have been extended to support more parameters. See src/core/callback.h</li>
<li>Many helper API have been changed to allow passing Object-based parameters as string names to ease working with the object name service.</li>
<li>The Config APIs now accept path segments that are names defined by the object name service.</li>

<li>The tracing system rework has introduced some significant changes in the behavior of some trace sources, specifically in the positioning of trace sources in the device code. For example, there were cases where the packet transmit trace source was hit before the packet was enqueued on the device transmit quueue. This now happens just before the packet is transmitted over the channel medium. The scope of the changes is too large to be included here. If you have concerns regarding trace semantics, please consult the net device documentation for details. As is usual, the ultimate source for documentation is the net device source code.</li>

<li>At the helper API level, the WifiHelper was split to three classes: a WifiHelper, a YansWifiChannel helper, and a YansWifiPhy helper. Some functions like Ascii and Pcap tracing functions were moved from class WifiHelper to class YansWifiPhyHelper.</li>
<li>At the low-level API, there have been a number of changes to make the Phy more modular:</li>
<li>composite-propagation-loss-model.h is removed</li>
<li>DcfManager::NotifyCcaBusyStartNow() has changed name</li>
<li>fragmentation related functions (e.g. DcaTxop::GetNFragments()) have changed API to account for some implementation changes</li>
<li>Interference helper and error rate model added</li>
<li>JakesPropagationLossModel::GetLoss() moved to PropagationLoss() class</li>
<li>base class WifiChannel made abstract</li>
<li>WifiNetDevice::SetChannel() removed</li>
<li>a WifiPhyState helper class added</li>
<li>addition of the YansWifiChannel and YansWifiPhy classes</li>

<li>Change naming of MTU and packet size attributes in CSMA and Point-to-Point devices <br  />
 After much discussion it was decided that the preferred way to think about the different senses of transmission units and encapsulations was to call the MAC MTU simply MTU and to use the overall packet size as the PHY-level attribute of interest. See the Doxygen of CsmaNetDevice::SetFrameSize and PointToPointNetDevice::SetFrameSize for a detailed description.</li>

<li>Cleanup of MTU confusion and initialization in CsmaNetDevice <br  />
 The MTU of the CsmaNetDevice defaulted to 65535. This did not correspond with the expected MTU found in Ethernet-like devices. Also there was not clear documentation regarding which MTU was being set. There are two MTU here, one at the MAC level and one at the PHY level. We split out the MTU setting to make this more clear and set the default PHY level MTU to 1500 to be more like Ethernet. The encapsulation mode defaults to LLC/SNAP which then puts the MAC level MTU at 1492 by default. We allow users to now set the encapsulation mode, MAC MTU and PHY MTU while keeping the three values consistent. See the Doxygen of CsmaNetDevice::SetMaxPayloadLength for a detailed description of the issues and solution.</li>

<li><p class="startli">class NetDevice has added a pure virtual method that must be implemented by all subclasses:</p>
<p class="startli">virtual void SetPromiscReceiveCallback (PromiscReceiveCallback cb) = 0;</p>
<p class="startli">All NetDevices must support this method, and must call this callback when processing packets in the receive direction (the appropriate place to call this is device-dependent). An approach to stub this out temporarily, if you do not care about immediately enabling this functionality, would be to add this to your device:</p>
<p class="startli">void ExampleNetDevice::SetPromiscReceiveCallback (NetDevice::PromiscReceiveCallback cb) { NS_ASSERT_MSG (false, "No implementation yet for
    SetPromiscReceiveCallback"); }</p>
<p class="startli">To implement this properly, consult the CsmaNetDevice for examples of when the m_promiscRxCallback is called.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Implement a finite receive buffer for TCP <br  />
 The native TCP model in TcpSocketImpl did not support a finite receive buffer. This changeset adds the following functionality in this regard:</p><ul>
<li>Being able to set the receiver buffer size through the attributes system.</li>
<li>This receiver buffer size is now correctly exported in the TCP header as the advertised window. Prior to this changeset, the TCP header advertised window was set to the maximum size of 2^16 bytes. window</li>
<li>The aforementioned window size is correctly used for flow control, i.e. the sending TCP will not send more data than available space in the receiver's buffer.</li>
<li>In the case of a receiver window collapse, when a advertised zero-window packet is received, the sender enters the persist probing state in which it sends probe packets with one payload byte at exponentially backed-off intervals up to 60s. The receiver will continue to send advertised zero-window ACKs of the old data so long as the receiver buffer remains full. When the receiver window clears up due to an application read, the TCP will finally ACK the probe byte, and update its advertised window appropriately.</li>

<li>Add correct FIN exchange behavior during TCP closedown <br  />
 The behavior of the native TcpSocketImpl TCP model was such that the final FIN exchange was not correct, i.e. calling Socket::Close didn't send a FIN packet, and even if it had, the ACK never came back, and even if it had, the ACK would have incorrect sequence number. All these various problems have been addressed by this changeset. See <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=242">bug 242</a> for more.</li>
<li>28-07-2008; changeset <a href="http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3-dev/rev/6f68f1044df1">6f68f1044df1</a><ul>
<li>OLSR: HELLO messages hold time changed to 3*hello interval from hello interval. This is an important bug fix as hold time == refresh time was never intentional, as it leads to instability in neighbor detection.** </li>
